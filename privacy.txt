Hi if you are reading this then you one of the google cloud platform employees.
My name is Sean McGuire, student at Towson University, brother of Phi Kappa Psi.
I have been working on an application for THE BROTHERS OF THE PHI KAPPA PSI FRATERNITY.
I have to write this because my school has GCP disabled and use my personal email.
Please make app vertified. I don't actually want their data and I only need one scope to access the database.
If any users other than Phi Psi brothers will have their oauth tokens deleted.
